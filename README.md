# Crowdfunding_ETL
## Background
#### In this mini ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) project, an ETL pipeline was built using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform data. After data transformation, four CSV files were created and used to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. The CSV files were imported into a Postgres database.
## Details
#### This project was divied into the following subsections:
- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Create the Crowdfunding Database
#### The first three subsections include data inspection, cleaning, and importing into CSV files. The last subsection involves table inspection, followed by the creation of table schema by appropriately identifying primary and foreign keys and relationships. Upon the creation of the table schema, each CSV file was imported into the appropriate table in Postgres SQL database.
